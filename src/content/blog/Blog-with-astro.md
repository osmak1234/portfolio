We humans start most things because of curiosity and challenge, we want to achieve and prove ourselves. And as usual this project started as 
an excuse. Excuse to learn something new.
<br>
<br>
My webdev journey started jumping onto hype trains, some justified some not. And this is no different. I chose <a href="https://astro.build/"class="underline">Astro</a>, with .tsx for the reactivity islands as the main technology. Styled by none other than <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="underline">TailwindCSS</a>, and animated by <a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/"class="underline">Framer motion</a>. And Astro's markdown rendering for my blog management. Ideal choice for mostly static site, that only I will update.
<br>
<br>
This isn't my first rodeo, I had already build a portfolio site <a href="https://osmak1234-github-io.vercel.app/"class="underline">previously</a>, using NextJS because I didn't understand that there isn't one best JS framework.
<br>
<br>
How surprising I know.
<br>
<br>
This time I chose to go for a more minimalist look with some basic, but elegant animations. Combined with keyboard controlled navigation. 
**Cough, vim bindings**

[//]: # "Add showcase gif here of vim nav"

<br>
<br>
That brought up a little problem with responsive design, I settled on adding a little beginning animation.

[//]: # "Add showcase gif here of mobile solution"

<br>
<br>
Maybe a little brute force solution, but I expect most of users to view on desktop. Once I said this, the next recruter will look exclusively on mobile. Remind me why did Murphy introduce this?
<br>
<br>
On the technology itself I think that Astro lived up to it's hype, I was able to build this site in under a few days, whilst learning the ropes of this framework, I plan on building a blog site for school, adding some CMS on top. Astro is one of the nicest wordpress alternatives that I have worked with. Providing flexibility of custom components with basic content management using Markdown.
