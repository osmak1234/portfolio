I have recently started hearing more and more about people who care about their online privacy. Maybe it's just my internet bubble, but I think the general public is starting to catch on.
<br>
<br>
Who recently hasn't seen one of <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.aura.com/">**aura's**</a> adds or, read about some huge fine given to one of the data giants like Google or Facebook. VPNs are also now widely used and I think that it's time to say no to these big companies.
<br>
<br>
Most people dismiss the argument with some simple argument like:
<br>
<br>
_"I'm not doing anything illegal, so why should I care about letting someone look at my data."_
<br>
<br>
And I think that this quote sums it up perfectly:
<br>
<br>
_"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."_
<br>
<br>
Privacy doesn't matter until it does. And then it will be too late to start. Most of the simple setups cost you a little bit of convenience + time to setup.
<br>
<br>
With that out of the way this is my

<br>
<h2 class="text-[36px] font-bold">Privacy setup</h2>

<br>
<h2 class="text-[30px] font-bold">1) Browser</h2>

<br>
What most people need within a browser?

<ul style="list-style:inside">
  <li>Search history sync with mobile</li>
  <li>Store unimportant credential</li>
  <li>Good user experience</li>
</ul>
<br>
All of that is provided inside <a href="https://librewolf.net/" class="underline">Librewolf</a>, you will need to enable firefox sync for better mobile experience and loosen up some security rules, but it's just a simple form with checkboxes. (Librewolf doesn't have mobile client, so you'll need to use firefox, but you can install <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" class="underline">Ublock</a>)
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="text-[28px] font-bold">
  1.1) Search engine
</h3>
<br>
There are a few alternatives
<ul style="list-style:inside">
  <li>BraveSearch</li>
  <li>DuckDuckGo</li>
  <li>Whoogle</li>
  <li>Kagi</li>
</ul>
<br>
I personally use a combination of self hosted <a href="https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search" class="underline">Whoogle</a> instance (It get's a search query from google on your behalf, removes adds, trackers, and than displays it)  and
<a href="https://kagi.com/" class="underline">Kagi</a>
if needed. Although 5$ per month can be quiet expensive, so Whoogle will be enought for most people.

<br>
<br>
<h3 class="text-[28px] font-bold">
  1.2) Browser extensions
</h3>

<br>
<ul style="list-style:inside">
<li><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/" class="underline">Ublock</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/" class="underline">Dark reader</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1password-x-password-manager/" class="underline">1Password</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/private-relay/" class="underline">Firefox relay</a></li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2 class="text-[30px] font-bold">2) Operating system</h2>
<br>
I personally use Arch btw, for most people 
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/workstation" class="underline">Fedora</a> will be the choice.
<br>
I won't go into detail, but main takeaway would be 
<br>
Windows < MacOS < Linux
<br>
At least from a privacy standpoint.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="text-[30px] font-bold">3) Email</h2>
<a href="https://proton.me/" class="underline">Proton mail</a>
is my go to, but they have their flaw, 
<a href="https://proton.me/legal/law-enforcement" class="underline">law enforcement</a>.
<br>
<br>
I personally use Gmail. Mostly because of the login with login with google account. And it's one of the arguably negotiable deals. Because abandoning whole google is hard once you buy into the ecosystem. I'm currently working on slowly migrating but it will take time.

<br>
<br>

<h2 class="text-[30px] font-bold">Summary</h2>
Few rules you should consider when it comes to the services you use.
<br>
<ul style="list-style:inside">
  <li>Is it really free?</li>
  <li>Is the tool worth the data?</li>
  <li>How hard is it to transition once you buy in?</li>
  <li>Ownership of your data</li>
</ul>
