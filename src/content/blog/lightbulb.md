Draft num. 2

When is the last moment when something clicked into place out of nowhere? Maybe it was a few days ago when you tried to remember name of some song.
Or coming up with some solution to a problem at work. It happens from time to time. Would you like it to happen more often?

The result is the work of subconcious mind at work. But what does it truly mean? Your brain has 2 systems, or processors if you'd like. One is the concious voice in your brain. You can direct it, but it's mostly difficult to do larger calculations, usually containing more than 4 things at once. That's when the second system comes in place. It allows for automatic processes to form. And than it uses them when prompted. The unconcious system is much more powerfull but harder to direct.

That's when directed meditation comes in. If you are familiar with standard mediation you usually try to empty your mind of thoughts, you focus on one thing at a time, in most sessions your breath. But in this form, main focus is prodding your mind in the right direction. Main part is doing this with something to write with and on. Ideas will come if you can direct your unconcious mind. So you first try some deep breathing excercise to clear your mind and than bring the thing into focus. You won't actively try to do something with it. Just let it materialize in your mind. Leave it be. Important step is for you to care for your unconcious mind to care. After about a 10 minute sessions go do some arbitrary task that requires a bit of motor function but almost no cognitive overhead.
Examples could be: cleaning your room, going for a walk, taking a shower. Something you have memorized and don't need to thing about it. You can chain these task with these habits. I usually use this in the evening. So I brush my teeth, clean my room a bit and than just relax. If no breakthroughs came through, it's totally alright consider doing this again the next day, in the mean time try to put at least some focused time in, and than let it go.
