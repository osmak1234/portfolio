Do you sometime after a seemingly normal day get a incredible surge of energy?

For some people this might happen during super early mornings, or late in the night. For me personally it happens around 8-9 pm and can last till 3 am.
You may be interested in why this happens scietificaly, or how can you manipulate the time when it comes.
