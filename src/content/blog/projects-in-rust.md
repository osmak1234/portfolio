I started my programming journey with the most classical modern web-dev route. Bouncing from framework to framework, not ever going much in depth,
or learning how the computer processes things under the hood. I almost exclusively copied code while just quickly scanning variable names and than "LGMT".
<br>
<br>
After some time I began thinking about going outside of my bubble and learning something completely new. I settled on rust and got to work.
I saw the hype and the opportunity to become a backend dev in the future as worth it. Everyone was recommending the rust book so I got to reading.
<br>
<br>
One week later 7 chapters in and I quit. I said it's too confusing. <br>
- Why would you use any of this?<br>
- Performance doesn't matter to me, I didn't buy a good computer to optimise it.<br>
- All this syntax to just do this simple thing.<br>
- I learnt all of this and I can't even show something for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
These were all the things I was thinking about not knowing how much further as a developer would it take me, if I were to just push through. 
I continued for a few months without moving anywhere, slowly working on my simple web project. I still learnt little bit every day.
